# ALX Project Nexus - ProDev Frontend Engineering Documentation

# Introduction
Project Nexus is the capstone milestone of the ProDev Frontend Engineering program.
This repository documents my major learnings, challenges, solutions, and best practices gained throughout the program.
It also serves as a knowledge hub for collaboration between Backend and Frontend learners.

# Objectives
* Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program.
* Document major frontend technologies, concepts, and solutions.
* Provide a reference guide for current and future learners.
* Foster collaboration with backend learners using APIs

# Key Technologies Covered
* Next.js-
* React-
* ReactNative-
* GraphQL-
* Rest API-
* PWA-
* TailwindCss-
* Nativewind-
* Expo-
# Frontend Engineering Concepts
1. UI/UX Design
2. Component Structure
3. PWA Fundamentals
4. Advanced Routing Techniques
5. API intergrations and also use of GraphQL

# Challenges and Solutions
* Challenge: Integrating API's to the frontend
   * Solution: use of Rapid API to get the needed API's
* Challenge: Creation of Many Components
   * Solution: use of [id.tsx] to reduce number of components created
     
# Best Practices and Takeaways
* Use of Tailwind Css to avoid having CSS on seperate files.
* Use of Error Boundary to catch errors in specific fields.
* Good component Structure to ensure easy location.
* Use of API's and GraphQL to avoid hardcoding data and also saving data externally out of code
* Use of PWA which has the ability to work offline, have smooth animations, fast transitions and many more
* Use of Figma to create a nice Design layouts Guide 

# Timeline
* Start Date: Sept 8, 2025
* Deadline: Sept 15, 2025
